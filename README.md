# Assignment2

I have attached screenshots of the code to the assignment here to the readme

For the above screenshot, I copied and pasted the code given previously, then changed the location of the data set by replacing the word "iris" with "wine" and ran the code from the beginning of the assignment. By changing the names, I am pulling the information that needs to be displayed in the decision tree from a different location; the set of data that includes the types of wine and other information regarding each type of wine.

I used the same process as before for this section. I copied and pasted the example given previously, then found the part of the code that controls the number of iterations the loop is supposed to run for to an arbitrarily large number, then changed the bounds of the bounds of the scatterplot to 10 and 6, since it was given to us in the "wine" dataset. 
but changed the iteration size to a very large number, then changed the bounds to 10 and 6 as given in the wine dataset.

This snippet of code describes how the MNIST model that was uploaded previously is trained and expressed using the random forest data set as an example. We then used the previously provided code as a template to load and fit the logistic regression model. The last line of code prints the accuracy of the linear regression model that was created previously.

This screenshot shows the code that was used to create the Machine Learning MLP (neural network) model. This code was taken directly from the example given during a previous class (the machine learning notebook). The second box displays the code that was used to print the accuracy of the Logistic, Random Forest, and Machine learning modeling/algorithms.

This is the part of the assignment I had the most fun with. I used the code given previously in the shared book as a template to write this. The only section of the code that needed to be changed was the name of the image path in the first line. This section of code is what determines the picture that is used to run the analysis. From my understanding, the name of the image path describes the location of the previously downloaded file relative to the individual device. The image is uploaded and run through the compiler, resized, and converted into a NumPy array, and then the inference function is performed to determine the objects found in the given picture. I had originally used a different picture, but the resulting analysis was only 38% positive that I was a person, so I took that a little personally and tried to find a picture that looked more "human".
