# Assignment2

I have attached screenshots of the code to the assignment here to the readme

For the above screenshot, I copied and pasted the code given previously and edited the location of the data set from "iris" to "wine" and ran the code from the beginning of the assignment.

I used the same process as before for this section also. I copied and pasted the example given previously, but changed the iteration size to a very large number, then changed the bounds to 10 and 6 as given in the wine dataset.
